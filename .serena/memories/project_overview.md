# Project Overview

## Purpose

This is a **GitHub Actions TypeScript template** repository that serves as a
starting point for creating custom GitHub Actions using TypeScript. It provides
a complete development environment with:

- TypeScript compilation and bundling
- Testing infrastructure
- CI/CD workflows
- Code quality tools (linting, formatting)
- Local testing utilities

The template includes a simple example action that waits for a specified number
of milliseconds and outputs the current time.
